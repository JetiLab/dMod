\usage{
compile(..., output = NULL, args = NULL, cores = 1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more objects of class \code{parfn}, \code{obsfn}, or \code{prdfn}.
Corresponding source files (e.g. \code{model.c}) are detected
automatically based on the current \code{modelname}.}

\item{output}{Optional character string. If provided, all detected source
files are compiled and linked into a single shared library named
\code{paste0(output, .Platform$dynlib.ext)}. If \code{NULL}, each source file is
compiled and linked into its own shared library.}

\item{args}{Optional character string of additional compiler or linker
flags passed to \verb{R CMD SHLIB}. If \code{NULL} or empty, compilation defaults
to \code{-O3 -DNDEBUG}.}

\item{cores}{Integer specifying the number of CPU cores used for parallel
compilation of individual source files. Parallel compilation is enabled
when \code{cores > 1}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, compiler and linker output is printed
to the R console.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if compilation and linking succeed.
}
\description{
Compiles one or more model-related objects of class \code{parfn}, \code{obsfn}, or
\code{prdfn} into dynamically loadable shared libraries (\code{.so} on Unix-alike
systems, \code{.dll} on Windows).

The function automatically detects C and C++ source files associated
with each object based on its \code{modelname}, compiles them, and links them
into shared libraries which are loaded into the current R session.
}
\details{
Any previously loaded shared libraries with matching names are unloaded
prior to linking. Successfully linked libraries are loaded automatically.

When \code{output} is specified, the \code{modelname} of each input object is
overwritten with \code{output} to ensure consistent symbol naming across all
compiled routines. In addition, the attributes \code{sourcefiles} (C/C++
source files) and \code{objfiles} (corresponding object files) are added to
each object for diagnostic purposes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
## Compile a single model into separate shared libraries
x <- odemodel(reactions)
compile(x)

## Compile multiple models into a single shared library
compile(x, g, output = "combined")
}
